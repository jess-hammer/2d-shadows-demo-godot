# 2d-shadows-demo-godot
 This project is a demo of how to use a shader to create 2D directional shadows! You can customise the color, length, angle and softness of the shadows. The shader uses Signed Distance Fields provided by the Godot engine.

> Built with Godot 4.1.2

### With hard shadows:
(Adjust the gradient in the shader params to acheive this)
